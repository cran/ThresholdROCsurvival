Description: We focus on the diagnostic ability assessment of medical tests when the outcome of interest is the status (alive or dead) of the subjects at a certain time-point t. This binary status is determined by right-censored times to event and it is missing for those subjects censored before t. Here we provide three methods (missing exclusion, imputation of censored times and using time-dependent ROC curves) to evaluate the diagnostic ability of binary and continuous tests in this context. Two references for the methods used here are Skaltsa et al. (2010) <doi:10.1002/bimj.200900294> and Heagerty et al. (2000) <doi:10.1111/j.0006-341x.2000.00337.x>.
